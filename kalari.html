        Kalaripayattu is the martial art form of Kerala. Kalaripayattuâ€™s influence can be seen in most of the art forms of Kerala. In the past kalaris (combat arena or battle field) formed an integral part of the lives of the people. Without any gender discrimination boys and girls in their childhood would be sent to the Kalaris for practicing. With social life undergoing changes, the position of Kalaris and their influence changed. Today, Kalaripayattu is staged during festivals and other occasions as a showpiece. People are more interested in kalari treatment (as a system of medicine) and Marmachikitsa (treatment of vital parts).
