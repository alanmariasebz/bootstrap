        Margamkali is a dance form performed by 12 men representing the 12 disciples of Christ. It is a ritual art form performed by men on the occasion of the Christian days of celebration, and on eve of weddings, with the performances continuing till dawn. Until recently, during festivities of the Syrian Christians, both Margamkali and Parichamuttukali (a martial dance form of Kerala) were performed. The first research paper on Margamkali was published by the eminent expert Chummar Choondal, a folk performance instructor, and the head of the Department of Malayalam at St. Thomas College, Thrissur. The dance form has gathered some visibility only recently.
