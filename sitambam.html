        Silambam is a popular variant of martial arts which is performed with the aid of some specific weapons, primarily with bamboo sticks. It is widely performed in the regions of Tamil Nadu (India) which is also the birthplace of the game, where it emerged in around 1000 years BCE. The Tamil Sangam literature has the early records of Silambam. It's an ancient weapon-based martial art. The word Silambam etymologically means "staff from the hills" with the word meaning of "Silam" being "hills" and "Kambu" being "staff or sticks". The game is usually played on an even hard surface where the players use a bamboo stick with its length equivalent to their heights. Overall, there are 16 forms of footwork present in this martial art.
