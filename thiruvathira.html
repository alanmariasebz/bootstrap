    Thiruvathirakali or Kaikottikaliis a unique dance performed in Kerala on the auspicious day of Thiruvathira, the birthday of Lord Shiva. It is performed by women who seek blessings for eternal marital bliss. It falls in the Malayalam month of Dhanu (December-January). As per Hindu mythology, this dance is what brought Kamadeva (God of Love) back to life when he had been burnt to ashes by Lord Shiva's fury.

Groups of up to eight or ten women are seen dressed in traditional Kerala attire, dancing in a circle. The graceful movements of the dance are both enchanting and elegant. The white saris with colourful borders along with fresh jasmines adorning their hair make for a wonderful sight.
